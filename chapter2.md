# Economic Concepts and Graphical Representations

This repository provides a detailed explanation of several key economic concepts such as **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**, **Hyperinflation**, **Monetary Policy**, and **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, along with their graphical representations to enhance understanding. These visualizations will help clarify how economic variables interact and change over time.

## 1. GDP Components and Expenditure Approach

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Consumption (C)      | Household spending on goods and services         | 70%                     |
| Investment (I)       | Business investments in capital and housing      | 15%                     |
| Government Spending (G) | Government expenditure on public services        | 15%                     |

This table presents examples of hyperinflation in different countries, highlighting the severity and duration of the crises.

### Graph: Hyperinflation and Currency Value
This graph shows how **hyperinflation** devalues a country's currency, leading to a sharp decline in its value.

## 5. Monetary Policy

### Table: Types of Monetary Policy

| Type                | Description                                      | Effect on Economy          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Expansionary Policy  | Increasing money supply, lowering interest rates | Boosts economic activity   |
| Contractionary Policy| Decreasing money supply, raising interest rates  | Slows economic activity    |

This table shows the two main types of monetary policy and their intended effects on the economy.

### Graph: Expansionary vs. Contractionary Monetary Policy
This graph demonstrates how monetary policy impacts aggregate demand and GDP through changes in interest rates.

## 10. Hyperinflation Example: Post-WWI Germany

### Table: Hyperinflation Impact

| Year                | Inflation Rate (%)   | Currency Value   | Major Impact         |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------I've structured the updated `README.md` to include a table for each concept before its respective graph, offering additional explanations. This should help users better understand each concept by providing context through tables before visualizing the data in graphs.

The tables provide data comparisons (e.g., between nominal and real GDP), formulas (e.g., for GDP deflator), or specific values (e.g., hyperinflation examples). These elements are followed by the relevant graph for that concept to further illustrate the relationships.

Let me know if you need any adjustments or additional concepts!

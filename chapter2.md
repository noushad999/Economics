## 1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

### Overview
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period.

### Key Points
- **Definitions**:
  - **Expenditure Approach**: Total spending on domestically-produced goods and services.
  - **Income Approach**: Total income earned by domestically located factors of production.
- **Components of GDP**:
  - **Consumption (C)**: Household expenditures.
  - **Investment (I)**: Business and residential investments.
  - **Government Spending (G)**: Public sector expenditures.
  - **Net Exports (NX)**: Exports minus imports.

### Table: U.S. GDP Components (2005)

| Component       | % of GDP | Value ($ billion) |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Consumption      | 70.0%    | 8,745.7          |
| Investment       | 16.9%    | 2,105.0          |
| Government       | 18.9%    | 2,362.9          |
| Net Exports      | -5.8%    | -725.0           |
| **Total GDP**    | 100%     | 12,488.6         |

## 2. Circular Flow Model

### Overview
The circular flow model illustrates the flow of goods, services, and money between households and firms in an economy.

### Key Points
- **Households**: Supply labor and capital; receive income.
- **Firms**: Produce goods/services; earn revenue from households.
- **Equilibrium**: Total income equals total expenditure.

## 3. Real vs. Nominal GDP

### Overview
- **Nominal GDP**: Reflects the value of goods and services at current prices.
- **Real GDP**: Adjusts for inflation using base-year prices to reflect the real output.

### Formula
```math
GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) × 100

### **Step 5: Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
```markdown
## 4. Consumer Price Index (CPI)

### Overview
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average price change of a fixed basket of goods and services consumed by households.

### Formula
```math
CPI = (Cost of Basket in Current Year / Cost of Basket in Base Year) × 100

### **Step 6: GNP vs. GDP**
```markdown
## 5. GNP vs. GDP

### Overview
- **GDP**: Measures the total value of production within a country's borders.
- **GNP**: Includes total income earned by a nation's residents, including income earned abroad, and excludes income earned domestically by foreigners.

### Formula
```math
GNP = GDP + Net Income from Abroad


---

### **Step 7: Labor Market Metrics**
```markdown
## 6. Labor Market Metrics

### Overview
Metrics like unemployment rate and labor force participation rate provide insights into economic performance and workforce activity.

### Key Metrics
- **Unemployment Rate**:
```math
Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100
